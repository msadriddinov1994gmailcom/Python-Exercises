text = input('Please enter the text: ')
letter = input('Please enter the letter: ')
replaced = text.replace(' ', '')
counter = replaced.count(letter)
print(int((counter/len(replaced))*100))
text = input('Please enter the text: ')
letter = input('Please enter the letter: ')
replaced = text.replace(' ', '')
counter = replaced.count(letter)
