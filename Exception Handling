#Exception Handling
#An ATM machine takes the amount to be withdrawn as input and calls the corresponding withdrawal method. 
#In case the input is not a number, the machine should output "Please enter a number". Use exception handling to take a number as input, 
#call the withdraw() method with the input as its argument, and output "Please enter a number", in case the input is not a number.

def withdraw(amount):
   print(str(amount) + " withdrawn!")
try:
   amount = int(input('Please enter the amount you want to withdraw: '))
   withdraw(amount)
except ValueError:
   print('Please enter a number')
