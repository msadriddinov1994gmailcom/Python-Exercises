#Lambda
#You are given code that should calculate the corresponding percentage of a price. Somebody wrote a lambda function to accomplish that, however the lambda is wrong. Fix the code to output the given percentage of the price.

price = int(input())
perc = int(input())
​
res = (lambda x,y:(x*y)/100)(price, perc)
​
print(res)
