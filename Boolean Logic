#Boolean Logic
#You need to create a program that outputs whether a store is Open or Closed, based on the hour and the day of the week.
#The store is open on all days from 10 to 21, except Saturday and Sunday.
#You need to take the hour and the day of the week as input.
#The day of the week is represented as an integer (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.)

hour = int(input())
day = int(input())
# your code goes here
if day <6:
    if hour >= 10 and hour<=21:
        print('Open')
    else:
        print('Closed')
else:
    print('Closed')
