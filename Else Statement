#Else Statement
#Pythagoras theorem says: In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.
#Write a program that takes lengths of triangle sides as inputs, and output whether our triangle is right-angled or not. If the triangle is right-angled, the program should output "Right-angled", and "Not right-angled" if it's not.

side1 = int(input())
side2 = int(input())
side3 = int(input())
isRight = side3**2 == side1**2+side2**2
