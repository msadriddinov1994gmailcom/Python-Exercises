#Inheritance
#You are making a drawing application, which has a Shape base class. The given code defines a Rectangle class, creates a Rectangle object and calls its area() and perimeter() methods. Do the following to complete the program:

Inherit the Rectangle class from Shape.
Define the perimeter() method in the Rectangle class, printing the perimeter of the rectangle.
class Shape: 
    def __init__(self, w, h):
        self.width = w
        self.height = h
​
    def area(self):
        print(self.width*self.height)
​
class Rectangle(Shape):
    #your code goes here
    def perimeter(self):
        print(2*(self.width+self.height))
    
    
​
w = int(input())
h = int(input())
​
r = Rectangle(w, h)
r.area()
r.perimeter()
