#Decorators
#You are working on an invoicing system. The system has an already defined invoice() function, which takes the invoice number as argument and outputs it. You need to add a decorator for the invoice() function, that will print the invoice in the following format:

def decor(fun):
    def wrapper(num):
        print('***')
        fun(num)
        print('***')
        print('END OF PAGE')
    return wrapper
​
@decor
def invoice(num):
    print("INVOICE #" +num)
​
invoice(input());
