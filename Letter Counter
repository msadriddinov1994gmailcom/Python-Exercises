#etter Counter
#Given a string as input, you need to output how many times each letter appears in the string. You decide to store the data in a dictionary, with the letters as the keys, and the corresponding counts as the values. Create a program to take a string as input and output a dictionary, which represents the letter count.

text = input()
dict = {}
for n in text:
    dict[n] = text.count(n)
print(dict)
